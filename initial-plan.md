## Initial Plan - Building an End-to-End Insurance Claim Prediction Pipeline

The goal is to build a model to predict fraudulent insurance claims, and engineer the system around it, demonstrating my skills in data integration, data flow, Python, SQL, dbt, ML modeling, and MLOps concepts. 

Project Outline: "Predictive Fraud Detection Pipeline for Auto Insurance"

You can find public datasets for this on platforms like Kaggle. Search for "car insurance claims" or "insurance fraud detection".

Here’s how you can structure the project to showcase the skills they're looking for:

1. **Data Ingestion (Simulating Data Flow)**

- What to do: Don't just load a single CSV file. Set up a script that simulates receiving new data. For example, have a "source" folder where you periodically drop new batches of claim data (as separate CSV files). *Your Python script should automatically detect and process these new files*.

- Skills Shown: This mimics handling *data integrations* and *data flow*, a key responsibility. It shows you can think about production systems, not just one-off analyses.

- Tech Hint: Use Python's `os` or `pathlib` libraries to watch a directory for new files.

2. **Data Transformation & Modeling (The dbt & SQL part)**

- What to do: Use **dbt (Data Build Tool)** to clean, transform, and structure the raw data. This is the core of the "Analytical Engineer" workflow.
  - Staging: Create basic models that clean up column names and cast data types from the raw source data.
  - Transformation: Create intermediate models where you join different data sources (if you have them), and perform feature engineering (e.g., calculate the age of a vehicle at the time of the incident, or extract the day of the week from a date).
  - Final Marts: Create a final, clean "fact table" that is ready for machine learning.

- Skills Shown: Proficiency in SQL, understanding of data modeling principles, and direct experience with dbt, which is a highly sought-after tool for this role.

3. **Machine Learning Model (The Python & ML part)**
- What to do: Write a Python script that reads the clean data produced by dbt.
  - Train a simple classification model (like Logistic Regression or a Gradient Boosting model) using `scikit-learn` to predict whether a claim is fraudulent.
  - Save the trained model to a file (e.g., using `pickle` or `joblib`).
- Skills Shown: Python, Machine Learning, and understanding the link between data preparation and model training.

4. **Deployment & Serving (The MLOps & Engineering part)**
- What to do: This is where you really stand out. Don't just leave the model in a Jupyter Notebook
  - Create a simple API using `FastAPI` or `Flask` in Python. This API should have an endpoint (e.g., `/predict`) that accepts new claim data (as JSON) and returns the model's fraud prediction
  - Use **Docker** to containerize your API. This makes it a portable, self-contained application.
- Skills Shown: This demonstrates basic **MLOps** principles. It shows you can make your work usable by other applications and that you understand deployment, which is related to their mention of **Kubernetes**.

**How to Present It**:
Create a **GitHub repository** with a very clear structure and an excellent README.md file.

- README.md: This is your project's front page. Explain the project's purpose, the architecture (a simple diagram helps!), the tech stack you used, and clear instructions on how to set it up and run it (e.g., dbt run, docker build, docker run).
